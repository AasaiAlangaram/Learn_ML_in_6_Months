<h1>Week 1: Importing Datasets</h1>



<h2>Importing Datasets</h2>


Data acquisition is a process of loading and reading data into notebook from various sources. To read any data using Python's pandas package, there are two important factors to consider, format and file path. Format is the way data is encoded. The path tells us where the data is stored.

```python
import pandas as pd
# read the online file by the URL provided above, and assign it to variable "df"
path="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-database/autos/imports-85.data"

df = pd.read_csv(path)
```
