<h3>Understanding Intents</h3>

Intents are the most important component because they try to determine what the user wants. What are they asking for? In other words, they capture the intent or goal of the user.

<h1>Week 2: Entities and Dialog</h1>



<h2>Entities</h2>


<h3>Understanding Entities</h3>

Entities allow us to capture specific values within the user utterance.

<h2>Dialog</h2>


<h3>Putting it All Together</h3>

The dialog component allow us to issue a response to the user based on the basis of their intent and the specifics of their request which we captured through entities we defined. A dialog is simply a tree of nodes, and each node will typically handle one particular scenario.

<h3>Building User-Friendly Chatbots</h3>

Whenever you design a chatbot you should consider the tone and personality of your chatbot.

Make sure you give your chatbot a name to differentiate between other chatbots and specify that it is a chatbot and lead the conversation by telling the customer the scope of the chatbot. For example:

This will help the customer manage expectations and focus our conversation to something that the chatbot can handle.

Three important rules of chatbot design:
1. Avoid including Yes and No in your answer.
2. Incorporate part of the userâ€™s question in your response.
3. Provide succinct and accurate answers.
