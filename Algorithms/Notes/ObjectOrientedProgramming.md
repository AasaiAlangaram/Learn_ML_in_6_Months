<h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>



<h2>Goals, Principles, and Patterns</h2>


In object-oriented paradigm each __object__ is an _instance_ of a _class_. Each class presents to the outside world a concise and consistent view of the objects that are instances of this class, without going into too much unnecessary detail or giving others access to the inner workings of the objects. The class definition typically specifies _instance variables_ also known as _data members_ that the object contains, as well as the _methods_ also known as _member functions_ that the object can execute. This view of computing is intended to fulfill several goals and incorporate several design principles, which we discuss in this chapter.
